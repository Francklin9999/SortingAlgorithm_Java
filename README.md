# Sorting Algorithm

This project is a **Visual Sorting Algorithm Simulator** built with Java Swing. It provides a graphical interface where users can select from various sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort) and visualize how the algorithms sort an array of integers in real-time. The application features animated bars representing the array elements, which dynamically rearrange themselves as the sorting algorithms execute, providing an educational and interactive way to understand the mechanics of different sorting techniques.
